I AM USING THE "PNPM PACKAGE MANAGER" TO MANAGE MY PACKAGES EFFICIENTLY.
BY USING IT: I DON'T NEED TO DOWNLOAD NODE MODULES EACH TIME FOR EACH PROJECT.
IT JUST MAKE A CENTRALIZED STORE ON THE ROOT OF THE COMPUTER, AND IT LINKS EVERY NEW PROJECT PACKAGES TO ALREADY DOWNLOADED NODE MODULES.
IT'S VERY STORAGE EFFICIENT.
IT USES THE SAME CONCEPT AS "REDUX" DOES FOR STATE MANAGEMENT.

HOW YOU CAN CONNECT DB IN INDEX.JS FILE BY IIFE

CODE:--------------------------
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import { DB_NAME } from './constants'
dotenv.config()
;(async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`)
    app
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Facing an issue while connecting to MONGODB ::\nERROR:: ${error}`)    
    throw error;
  }
})()
--------------------------
